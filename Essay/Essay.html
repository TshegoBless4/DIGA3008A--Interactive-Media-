      <h1>Essay (One)</h1>
    <section class="section-one">

        <h2>UI&UX website Analysis</h2>
        <h3>South African Website offering services: Takealot.com
Case Study</h3>
<p>
  In the ever-evolving landscape of digital experiences, the ethical roles of UX/UI
designers have become more crucial than ever. With individuals engaging with
thousands of digital
interfaces, designers' decisions have a direct impact on their behavior,
expectations, and even values. This case study explores the design of South
Africa’s leading e-commerce platform, Takealot.com, through the lens of ethical
UX/UI design, using readings by Juned Ghanchi’s Ethical Design: Why Is It
Critical for UX Designers? and Aparna K S Ethical UX Design and User Trust:
Why it Matters? This essay will analyse the usability of the website, its
accessibility and ethical designing of Takealot.com, while reflecting on the
responsibilities of designers in shaping digital cultures.
</p>

        <p>
Takealot.com is the leading ecommerce retailer in South Africa and one of the
largest, most innovative ecommerce retailers on the African continent. It offers
great customer services to South Africans from shopping all the way to
delivery. It has a user-friendly interface, with intuitive navigation, it offers
different categories and filter systems, visual presentations of the items people
buy, all which allow for a quick and efficient shopping. The website includes
features that allow customers to have an account personalization,
recommendations, real-time order tracking and secure payment processes.
The homepage design favours promotions and curated content across different
departments, while the product pages include high-resolution images
accompanied by the seller’s name, ratings, reviews. Product description and
information. Takealot.com also offers a responsive mobile experience through
its downloadable app and a mobile-optimized website to support access on
different devices. Functionally, the website appears faultless and effective.
However, when it is viewed through the lens of ethical design critically, some of
the design choices need to be critically observed and examined.
        </p>
<h3>Ethical Design as a UX Imperative</h3>
        <p>
Aparna’s article <i>Ethical UX Design and User Trust: Why it Matters?</i> Calls
attention to the need for ethical intention behind every UX decision. Aparna
defines ethical design as one that supports user autonomy, informed consent,
trust, and respect and encourages designers to reflect they are nudging users
toward healthy, transparent decisions or manipulating them for the sake of
business goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, Juned Ghanchi’s <i>Ethical Design: Why Is It Critical for UX Designers?</i> highlights the risks of bias, manipulation, and harm in digital products. Ghanchi
categorizes ethical design into dimensions like usability, privacy, influence,
sustainability, and societal impact. His argument reinforces that ethical
design is not aesthetics or usability, but rather it's about being deliberately
responsible to ensure that designs do not exclude or mislead users.
With these arguments, we can analyse Takelot.com not just on how well it
looks or works, but rather on whether it aligns with ethical UX principles.
        </p>
        <h3>Usability and Accessibility</h3>

        <p>
In terms of usability, Takealot.com performs well. The website utilizes well-
understood icons, clear product filters, a proper checkout process, and is quick
to load. These, according to Ghanchi, serve what he calls a designer’s ‘’moral
duty’’ towards functionality and reduce cognitive load. The site's
responsiveness is part of accessibility with its support for mobile users and its
adaption to different screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          However there are areas where accessibility could be improved. For instance,
Takealot.com website does not provide complete screen reader support and
has limited customizable visual features like contrast toggle or font size
changes. Minor things like these are what Ghanchi refers to as small decisions
that go towards ethical design in being attentive to individual needs, e.g
light/dark mode feature or a better visual comfort setting. Takealot.com could
be improved with more integration of such alternatives to accommodate
visually impaired consumers.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Ethical Considerations of Persuasion and Influence
        </h3>
        <p>
          One of the more morally subtle aspects of Takealot.com's interface design is its
use of persuasive UI patterns. The website uses urgency tactics such as "Only 2
Left in Stock" or "Limited Time Deal" which creates pressure to consumers to
purchase items impulsively. Aparna critiques such dark patterns for prioritizing
business outcomes over users’ well-being, and labels them unethical when
they manipulate rather than inform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another crucial ethical issue is algorithm-based recommendation engines that
often push forward products based on user activity. While this personalization
improves the shopping experience, it raises ethical concerns about data usage
and behavioural manipulation. Are users being shown what they need—or
merely what will generate the highest conversion? Ghanchi warns that the line
between white-hat and black-hat persuasion is thin, and crossing it undermines
user trust.</p>
<p>
Takealot.com does provide some transparency in the sense that they
allow users to modify their notification preferences, and they do state the use
of cookies. However, the ability for users to choose how their data is used for
product recommendations could reinforce ethical alignment.
        </p>
        <h3>Privacy and Data Ethics</h3>
        <p>
          Data privacy is a central UX ethical consideration. Ghanchi argues that ethical
design must include restrictions on what user data is collected and how it is
used. On Takealot.com, users are required to create an account and also have
to provide certain personal details like addresses and bank cards. The site
appears to encapsulate users' data with sufficiently secure encryption and
adheres to the e-commerce protocols. However, there is little transparency
regarding how long your data is stored, whether or not it is shared with third
parties, or any practices for anonymization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethical UX would encourage more empowerment of users, such
as allowing users to have more control over what data is stored, for how long,
and the option to delete accounts or data footprints. Aparna feels that
designers must consider consent as an ongoing process and not
a fixed checkbox, and Takealot.com should work towards making this
philosophy a reality.

        </p>
        <h3>Cultural and Societal Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          Design does not exist in a vacuum; it reflects and influences cultural
values. Ghanchi’s discussion of representation and bias highlights the
importance of ensuring that digital content reflects diverse users. Takealot.com
largely avoids overtly biased content, but it is not entirely inclusive neither. For
instance, product images and promotional content could better reflect South
Africa’s linguistic diversity as a country with 11 official languages, this could
make the platform feel more inclusive and locally grounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ethical design includes fostering mental well-being. Takealot's gamified
promotions, daily flash sales, and push notifications work to foster
overconsumption or decision fatigue. Ghanchi encourages designers to
consider sustainability in creating experiences that do not overwhelm or
exploit psychological motivation.
        </p>
        <h3>Designer Responsibility and Systemic Ethics</h3>
        <p>
          Aparna raises the question surrounding designing experiences that support a
healthy, humane digital world. As a leading
brand, Takealot.com holds influence over digital norms in South Africa. Its
design decisions therefore ripple through consumer behaviours and
expectations.
        </p>
<p>
  While most of its practices are e-commerce standard, one could consider
whether “standard” really should also mean “ethical.” Ghanchi reminds us that
UX designers need to fit not only the business goals but the needs of the global
and local communities. This entails designing for equity, transparency, and the
greater good, even when the design is not working toward short-term profits.
</p>
<h3>
  Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
  In analysing Takealot.com’s UX/UI design through the ethical frameworks
provided by Aparna K S and Juned Ghanchi, it is clear that while the site is
highly functional and user-centered on the surface,
it has more profound ethical issues that must be addressed. The website’s
reliance on persuasive design, few accessibility features and lack of adequate
user data transparency are representative of vast difficulties in digital design
industry.
However, these gaps also happen to leave space for opportunities. As Aparna
argues in the article, ethical design thus boils down to human-centered
decision-making that empowers, respects autonomy of and develops trust in
users. Ghanchi goes one step further by calling designers
to think about the impact they leave on privacy, sustainability, and society at
large.

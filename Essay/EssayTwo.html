      <h1>Essay (Two)</h1>
    <section class="section-one">
        <h2>The Intersection of the Internet, Geopolitics, and Digital Coloniality: A Case 
Study of Google Maps Renaming the Gulf of Mexico </h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
  The internet is influenced by geopolitical power structures, corporate decisions 
and historical inequalities.  The most recent action by Google Maps to rename 
the "Gulf of Mexico" as the "Gulf of America" for US users (BBC, 2025) shows 
how digital spaces reinforce forms of geopolitical dominance and digital 
coloniality —a modern form of control where powerful nations and 
corporations dictate digital representations (Ragnedda & Ruiu, 2017). This 
essay critically examines this event from the perspectives of digital inequalities 
(Lutz, 2019; Robinson et al., 2015) and social capital (Ragnedda & Ruiu, 2017), 
showing how geopolitical narratives are enabled by tech companies.
</p>

<h3>The Event: Google Maps and the Renaming Controversy </h3>

        <p>
In February 2025, Google Maps changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the 
Gulf of America for American users, following an executive order by President 
Donald Trump (BBC, 2025). It was defended that this change was framed as 
justification by Google's compliance with the guidelines from actual 
government sources, especially the U.S. Geographic Names Information System 
(GNIS), which had updated the name to reflect Trump's commitment to 
"restore names honoring American Greatness" (BBC, 2025). This unilateral 
decision gained more significance because the Gulf of Mexico is shared among 
three nations: the United States, Mexico, and Cuba. The renaming effectively 
erased Mexico's historical and geographical connection to this body of water in 
digital representations seen by U.S. users, while international users saw both 
labels: "Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)" (Reuters, 2025). This differential 
naming practice created fractured digital reality, where the same geographical 
feature is represented differently according to the geographical location of the 
user. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result, this sparked immediate diplomatic backlash from Mexico which 
argued that the U.S. had no legal right to rename a shared body of water under 
international law.
        </p>

<h3>The Three Levels of Digital Divide (Ragnedda & Ruiu, 2017)</h3>
        <p>
Ragnedda & Ruiu's (2017) framework of the three-level digital divide provides a 
critical framework for understanding the Gulf renaming controversy. Their 
model elaborates on three levels of digital inequality: 
        </p>
        <ol>
<li><p>
    First-level divide (access) - Differences in who has access to technologies. 
While this has traditionally referred to physical access to devices and 
connectivity, in this case study it manifests in who has the power to 
define digital representations of geography.
</p></li>
<li><p>
    Second-level divide (skills & usage) - Differences in the way people use 
the internet. In this case we see it with the different groups of users (U.S. 
vs. international) also experiencing different digital realities because of 
corporate decisions made in how to present their content.
</p>

</li>
<li><p>
    Third-level divide (outcomes) - The ways digital engagement translates 
into something beneficial or harmful in the real world. This is evident in 
how the renaming affects international relations and perceptions of 
sovereignty.
</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This case study deals particularly with the third-level digital divide, where 
digital platforms actually serve to reinforce offline power imbalances. The 
renaming of the Gulf goes on to prove that U.S. political straining dictates 
global digital representations, even against international objections, 
emphasizing what Robin et al. (2015) describe as the "stratification of digital 
spaces" (Ragnedda and Ruiu, 2017, p. 8). The selective use of the new name 
gives rise to what can be termed "digital territoriality" wherein control over 
digital representations becomes another extension of geopolitical power. This 
brings into focus the issue put forth by Lutz (2019) that digital inequalities not 
only pertain to access but also hinge upon who controls the narratives and 
representation within digital spaces. The Gulf renaming case exemplifies the 
very way through which digital platforms such as the internet become agents in 
what Ragnedda & Ruiu (2017) describe as symbolic domination in the digital 
space, in which the control of naming and representation becomes a form of 
soft power.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Digital Coloniality and Social Capital </h3>

        <p>
The concept of digital coloniality that is explored based on the sources means 
the way dominant countries and corporations take control over the digital 
infrastructures enforcing their cultural and political standards 
globally(Robinson et al., 2015) In the case of Google renaming the Gulf based 
on U.S. government orders while ignoring Mexico's protest of the term, shows 
how digital platforms act as instruments of soft power. This follows what Lutz 
(2019) calls the “algorithmic control” (Lutz, 2019, p. 143) of geopolitical 
narratives, where corporate decisions regarding digital representational can 
lead to actual, diplomatic impact in the real world. This case shows the 
geographical politics of digital realms, where the control of the digital 
representation is the new battleground in which national power can be 
exercised.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ragnedda & Ruiu (2017) present the argument that social capital (networks, 
trust, and influence) is critical to inequalities that occur in the digital context. 
Some of the main dynamics that we could observe in this case are: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>
                The U.S government used its political capital to force a change of name, 
and such an example shows how state actors can use digital platforms to 
impose geopolitical narratives.   
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                The diplomatic protest by Mexico was marginalized in the digital 
platform, a task that depicted as unequal social capital in the 
construction of digital narratives. It is an interpretation of what Robinson 
et al. (2015) call the "power relations" (Robinson et al., 2015, p. 578) of 
digital platforms. 
            </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This case shows how digital platforms have become what Ragnedda & Ruiu 
(2017) might call capital conversion machines, where political capital can be 
converted into digital forms that can be used to support geopolitical narratives. 
These differential naming practices generate the algorithmic sorting in digital 
spaces, as users of the same digital platforms perceive reality differently due to 
geographical location and political priorities of platform owners. 

        </p>

        <h3>
         Analysis: Geopolitics and Corporate Power in Digital Spaces 
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Corporate Compliance with State Power  </li>
            <p>
                The move by Google demonstrates corporate deference toward state power, 
even in the cases when it is challenged on internationally. This is reminiscent of 
the colonial processes of the past in which territorial dominance was 
implemented through the creation of maps (Robinson et al., 2015). This is 
mirrored in the digital where sites such as Google Maps act as the agents of 
geographic truth in the modern day. The quickness of Google to effect the 
change of name in response to the executive order is an exemplification of 
what Lutz (2019) refers to as algorithmic responsiveness of technology 
platforms towards state power. According to Robinson et al. (2015), the reality 
of only a few corporations being in charge of digital mapping results introduces 
points of weakness in which geopolitical narratives can be easily modified 
through digital representations.
            </p>
            <li>Differential Visibility and Digital Sovereignty  </li>
            <p>
                This selective renaming, in which the name Gulf of America is used only with 
the U.S. users and the name Gulf of Mexico is preserved with the Mexican 
users, displays a geopolitical division of the digital space. This aligns with Lutz's 
(2019) argument that digital inequalities are shaped by offline hierarchies. 
When Google tailors geographic terms according to national borders, the 
company enforces a disjointed digital environment in which the truth varies 
according to location. Such a habit results in the so-called digital parallel 
realities, as stated by Ragnedda & Ruiu (2017) where users in various countries 
get access to diverse variants of geographical truth.
                
    
            </p>
        </ol>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          The renaming of the Gulf of Mexico controversy shows that digital spaces such 
as Google Maps can turn into tools of geopolitical power enforcing digital 
coloniality through algorithmic decisions. This case exposes the impact of tech 
companies recreating real-world inequalities in digital spaces by prioritizing the 
U.S. political discourse over Mexican sovereignty. This selective renaming to 
American users generates parallel digital realities, enforcing what Ragnedda & 
Ruiu (2017) call the third-level digital divide- where online representations 
directly impact offline power relations. This case calls for the need to contest 
corporate-managed digital infrastructures that normalize geopolitical 
dominance that naturalize geopolitical supremacy under the guise of neutral 
platforms.

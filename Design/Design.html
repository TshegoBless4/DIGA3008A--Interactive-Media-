      <h1>Design</h1>
      <p>
        My goal for this website is to showcase my work such as presenting my
        game design, and my projects. I want this website to also demonstrate my
        process such as highlighting my design thinking, from wireframes and
        sketches to colour palettes. This website should also document my
        learning and growth as its reflected in my blogs where I highlighted the
        Challenges and my insights.
      </p>

      <h2>wireframes</h2>
      <li>Homepage</li>
      <p>
        On the top of the page will be the navagiation bar where users will be
        able to access the different pages. Below the navigation will be a
        welcome text following by a brief intro of myself accompanied by a
        picture. I will also place my contact details on my homepage, either on
        the footer or main section of the page (the bottom).
      </p>
      <p>
        My second idea was that the page navigation bar will be accessed both at
        the top of the page and and the bottom of the page. However, at the
        bottom will be pictures or icons representing different folders.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../Pictures/Homepage.png"
        alt="This is a picure of a Homepage wireframes"
        width="400"
        height="250"
      />

      <li>Blog Page</li>
      <img
        src="../Pictures/BlogPage.png"
        alt="This is a picture of a Blog page wireframe"
        width="400"
        height="250"
      />

      <li>Portfolio Page</li>
      <p>
        The page will open to a navigation bar at the top right of the page. I
        plan on showcasing drawings and games \ so it will be a combination of
        different pictures that represents that particular portfolio
      </p>
      <p>
        Another idea is a page showing two different kinds of portfolio. So on
        part will be showing only drawings and the other part will be showing
        only games
      </p>

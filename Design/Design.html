      <h1>Design Process</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Goal Alignment</h2>
        <p>
          The goal for this website is to curate a space that reflects who I am
          as a digital artist and designer inspired by the digital world. The
          theme I am aiming for is a tech-forward, and futuristic aesthetic that
          offers a sleek and appealing look. This website highlights my design
          process and is intended for potential collaborators or those
          interested in engaging with my work in a clean, tech-forward space.
        </p>

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>

        <h3>Visual Aesthetic</h3>
        <p>
          This website should present a clean, modern and tech tech-forward
          aesthetic with subtle sci-fi elements. The use of my colours is to
          provide a sleek yet futuristic vibe. Visually, it should have clean
          lines, subtle gradients or glows, and space to breathe. Think: sleek,
          cyber-cool, and modern.
        </p>

        <h3>Colour Palette</h3>
        <p>
          I chose a palette that aligns with the sci-fi theme, using a dark
          background with light, glowing accents to create a holographic effect.
          These contrasting tones enhance readability while highlighting key
          elements like titles.
        </p>

        <h3>Colour relationships</h3>
        <p>
          The use of my dark colours against lighter colours create contrast,
          especially in the UI elements such as the header, the navigation bar
          and enhances visibility of content
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of pink adds playfulness, my feminine side and warmth to my
          techy design, so I will use them as accent or highlight colours.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a Neutral balance, I tend to use greys and whites to help ground
          my layout, and giving breathing room between components.
        </p>

        />

        <h3>Fonts</h3>
        <p>
          For a sleek, futuristic look, I’m using Orbitron site-wide, , though
          it not advisable. This font reinforces the sci-fi and the digital
          theme I was aiming for when it is paired with UI elements. Since
          Oribtron is designed as a font display, to maintain readability I kept
          the body text large enough and unsured adequate line spacing.

        <h3>User Flow</h3>
        <p>This is a basic user flow of this website.</p>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Composition and layout:</h2>
        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>
          Consists of a classic website layout, top navigation bar, main content
          and footer
        </p>
        <h3>Hamburger menu</h3>
        <p>
          I added a hamburger menu to make my layout work on a mobile website,
          and make my website for interactable even when the deskop screen is
          more or less than 800px
        </p>
        <h3>Cards</h3>
        <p>
          I added cards for my blog posts, and for my portfolio page so that It
          gives a clean look.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also added card on my blog page so that it scrolls for the user , eg
          when the user clicks week 1,it should scroll to that particular
          section. I do intend on adding a button that scrolls back up so that
          users can just click it to scroll back to the top
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Homepage</strong>
            <p>
              The top of the page includes a navigation bar for easy access to
              different sections. Below it is a welcome text and a brief intro
              about me, followed by a photo. Contact details will be placed at
              the footer or near the bottom of the main section.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another idea is to also have quick access icons at the bottom, in
              addition to the top nav bar.
            </p>
            <img
              src="../Images/Homepage annotated wireframe.png"
              alt="Wireframe of the homepage showing navigation, intro, and contact sections"
            />
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Blog Page</strong>
            <p>
              This wireframe represents the layout for the blog page. It
              includes space for post previews, images, and possibly filters or
              categories to explore blog topics.
            </p>

              src="../Images/Blog page wireframe annotated.png"

              width="400"
              height="250"
            />
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Portfolio Page</strong>
            <p>
              The navigation bar will be at the top right. This page will
              showcase both my artwork and games, using images to represent each
              category.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alternatively, it may be split into two sections—one for drawings
              and another for games.
            </p>

              This wireframe outlines the design page, which highlights my
              design process including goal alignment, color palette, font
              choices, and wireframes.

    Week 1 – Blog Post
My experience of setting up Github wasn’t difficult. With the tutorials given, I found it quite simple to follow through. I learned the Github concepts and how to link VS Code to my repo, as well as to how to publish pages which I found interesting.
The reading I chose was The World-Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, Ari Luotonen, Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, and Arthur Secret. It caught my attention because the web is used by everyone in the world today who uses the internet. I found it mind blowing that it began as just a pool of human knowledge that allowed collaborators to share their ideas and knowledge on common project and how today it is accessed by people who still want to gain knowledge, share knowlegde or even learn something for different projects.
 People today still type a text, in instances where they search for something on the web to send to the server and in a second the information related to the text would be presented. I think it is amazing how technology has evolved whereas when the Web was developed in the past, it could be accessed on the computer and now the Web can be accessed across smart phones and It is not just limited to a computer. In relation to the user interface of the server today compared to past I would say it still the same if not similar as a W3 ‘’client’’ program, displaying document with texts when it starts, possibly images, the texts or phrases highlighted in blue. Today, however, when you click on the highlighted area you usually get a visual feedback on the area you have clicked like for instance the highlighted area turning into a different colour. 
Therefore I would like to think of The Web as an endless pool of information that can be accessed by people who want access to information. 
The interesting things I found about The History of the Web was its timeline between 2001-2006 where Wikipedia was invented in 2001 and it allowed everybody to contribute content and even edit , it was one way where people could gain information on the web. 
Another thing I found interesting was the realease of Safari in 2003. Safari is an Apple browser and today it is still used, bigger than ever with its millions of users of Apple around the world. I still use it today to read a biography of my favourite celebrity. Youtube too, it was launched in 2005 as a video sharing platform. Today it is very popular and it even generates income for millions of users. 
My goals for Interactive Media is firstly to be a good in  UI/UX designing and to understand the concepts surrounding it as I value the importance of user interface and user experience when I am using any app that allows me to buy goods and services. I believe that a good UI/UX is what makes an app successful. My other goal is to be able to develop a website that is easy to follow through.

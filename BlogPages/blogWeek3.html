    <h1>Week 3 - Blog Post</h1>

   <p> Mapping my Site’s Content, Experience, Interface
<li>	Content: I want my content to be structed so that users can easily navigate my site. On my homepage, is going to be a brief introduction about myself, a portfolio section of my work, a design process of the site, Blog section where I will put all my weekly blogs, and on the bottom of the page or footer, I will put my contact details where people can reach me. </li>
<li>	Experience: The navigation should feel intuitive, and the site should be responsive on mainly a desktop. Quick loading times and the user experience that include the styling will make the experience even more engaging.</li>
<li> Interface Elements: It should be simple and easy to use. This includes the navigation bar, search functionality, and call-to-action buttons. Maybe on my footer is where I will give links for details.</li> </p>
Linking User Alignment to URL Structure and Semantic Markup
My URL scheme should mirror the organization of my content, making it easier for users to follow along, therefore I am going to have:
•	/portfolio to showcase my work
•	/Blog/WeeklyBlogs for individual blog posts 
•	/Design Process for showing the structure of my website

Reflecting on Development Progress
This week, I have been focusing on organizing my site’s navigation, my hyperlinks and ensuring the content flows logically. I have also worked on the wireframing to structure how the contents of the website will be distributed and have created descriptive URLs. For the semantic markup, I make sure to use correct HTML tags to improve the accessibility of the website.

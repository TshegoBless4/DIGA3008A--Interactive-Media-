        <h2>Reflecting on Github and Future Goals (Blog 1 - Week 1)</h2>

        <p>
          Experience Setting up GitHub My experience of setting up Github wasn’t
          difficult. With the tutorials given, I found it quite simple to follow
          through.I learned the Github concepts and how to link VS Code to my
          repo,as well as to how to publish pages which I found interesting.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection On the readings</h2>
        <p>
          The reading I chose was The World-Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert
          Cailliau, Ari Luotonen, Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, and Arthur Secret. It
          caught my attention because the web is used by everyone in the world
          today who uses the internet. I found it mind blowing that it began as
          just a pool of human knowledge that allowed collaborators to share
          their ideas and knowledge on common project and how today it is
          accessed by people who still want to gain knowledge, share knowlegde
          or even learn something for different projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          People today still type a text, in instances where they search for
          something on the web to send to the server and in a second the
          information related to the text would be presented. I think it is
          amazing how technology has evolved whereas when the Web was developed
          in the past, it could be accessed on the computer and now the Web can
          be accessed across smart phones and It is not just limited to a
          computer. In relation to the user interface of the server today
          compared to past I would say it still the same if not similar as a W3
          ‘’client’’ program, displaying document with texts when it starts,
          possibly images, the texts or phrases highlighted in blue. Today,
          however, when you click on the highlighted area you usually get a
          visual feedback on the area you have clicked like for instance the
          highlighted area turning into a different colour. Therefore I would
          like to think of The Web as an endless pool of information that can be
          accessed by people who want access to information.
        </p>

        <p>
          Interesting things I found about the history of the web The
          interesting things I found about The History of the Web was its
          timeline between 2001-2006 where Wikipedia was invented in 2001 and it
          allowed everybody to contribute content and even edit , it was one way
          where people could gain information on the web. Another thing I found
          interesting was the realease of Safari in 2003. Safari is an Apple
          browser and today it is still used, bigger than ever with its millions
          of users of Apple around the world. I still use it today to read a
          biography of my favourite celebrity. Youtube too, it was launched in
          2005 as a video sharing platform. Today it is very popular and it even
          generates income for millions of users.
        </p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
          My goals for Interactive Media is firstly to be a good in UI/UX
          designing and to understand the concepts surrounding it as I value the
          importance of user interface and user experience when I am using any
          app that allows me to buy goods and services. I believe that a good
          UI/UX is what makes an app successful. My other goal is to be able to
          develop a website that is easy to follow through.

      <article class="section" id="blog2">
        <h2>Reflecting on:  Moulthrop, S. (2003) ‘You Say You Want a Revolution? Hypertext and the Laws of Media (1991)’ (Blog 2 - Week 2)</h2>
        <p>
          Stuart Moulthrop’s essay explores the evolution of hypertext, its
          revolutionary potential, and its digital era effects. He shows how
          hypertext develops from Vannevar Bush’s concept of the Memex, and how
          it led towards the development of digital text as we understand it
          today. Moulthrop also explores what happens when hypertext is pushed
          to its limit, using Marshall McLuhan’s theory that every medium, when
          pushes to its limits, reverses into its opposite. He also continues to
          question whether hypertext as an interactive and open medium will join
          the pattern of radio and television, which started as interactive but
          later became corporate-controlled and hierarchical, so in essence he
          questions whether hypertext would remain a tool of free interaction or
          become a controlled system. How does this speak to the internet today?
          The early web was an open space where users could contribute freely
          and share knowledge or information. For instance, when Wikipedia was
          developed in 2001, anyone could contribute and edit articles. But as
          years went by, the internet followed the pattern of radio and
          television becoming a controlled system that is dominated by big
          corporate companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon etc that is driven by
          algorithms, data collection and advertising. For instance social media
          platforms such as Tiktok, Instagram and Facebook controls interactions
          by dictating what we see using algorithms. While this may be a good
          thing to some, the disadvantages is that it reduces the ability to
          explore other things freely. We have come to notice that a web is now
          a marketplace and most people rely on on it to market their businesses
          or companies using advertisements.
        </p>

        <h2>Folder structure and URL Scheme</h2>
        <p>
        When designing my folder structure I aim for a clean structure to keep
        my files organised. So for instance in my Root folder (/) will contain
        main entry of the website being Index.html: This will direct users to
        different sections like home, Blog, Portfolio and design process. Home
        folder will contain (/home/) About.html where it will talk about myself
        or my work Contact.html: where my contacts will be put Portfolio
        (/portfolio/) Will showcase my previous projects so: index.html: The
        portfolio landing page, listing all projects.
        </p>
        <h3>URL Scheme</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="../index.html" target="_blank"> mywebsite → Home</a></li>
          <li>
            <a href="../BlogPages/blogMain.html" target="_blank"
              >mywebsite → Blogs</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
<p>
        URL Scheme and Decision-Making: About → mywebsite.com/home/about.html
        Portfolio page → mywebsite.com/portfolio/ Inspirational websites
        </p>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank"
            >pexels:https://www.pexels.com/</a
          >
        </li>

        <p>
          What does interaction mean to me? To me it is about anticipation and
          engagement. The internet allows users to not only consume content but
          to interact with it by commenting or sharing making it an interaction

        <h2>Mapping Out the Site's Content (Blog 3 - Week 3)</h2>

        <h3>Mapping my Site’s Content, Experience, Interface</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
            Content: I want my content to be structed so that users can easily
            navigate my site. On my homepage, is going to be a brief
            introduction about myself, a portfolio section of my work, a design
            process of the site, Blog section where I will put all my weekly
            blogs, and on the bottom of the page or footer, I will put my
            contact details where people can reach me.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            Experience: The navigation should feel intuitive, and the site
            should be responsive on mainly a desktop. Quick loading times and
            the user experience that include the styling will make the
            experience even more engaging.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            Interface Elements: It should be simple and easy to use. This
            includes the navigation bar, search functionality, and
            call-to-action buttons. Maybe on my footer is where I will give
            links for details.

        </ul>

        Linking User Alignment to URL Structure and Semantic Markup My URL
        scheme should mirror the organization of my content, making it easier
        for users to follow along, therefore I am going to have: • /portfolio to
        showcase my work • /Blog/WeeklyBlogs for individual blog posts • /Design
        Process for showing the structure of my website
        </p>

        <p>
          Reflecting on Development Progress This week, I have been focusing on
          organizing my site’s navigation, my hyperlinks and ensuring the
          content flows logically. I have also worked on the wireframing to
          structure how the contents of the website will be distributed and have
          created descriptive URLs. For the semantic markup, I make sure to use
          correct HTML tags to improve the accessibility of the website.

      <article class="section" id="blog4">
        <h2>IxD Process (Blog 4 - Week 4)</h2>

        <p>
          With my original wireframes for the Homepage I had a navigation bar
          for each and every folder, an image and a header that welcomes users
          to the website. For my blogs page, I had a navigation bar and a
          section that would put images of the blogs. For my current design
          section of my website, my website opens to a homepage. On the top of
          the page , is the navigation bar that would allow you to click on
          different sections such as the Portfolio, Design, and Blogs. Then
          after the navigation section, it is followed by a header written
          “Welcome t my page” accompanied by a picture of cars in the landscape
          however this might change into something that would describe me best
          such as an animated picture of myself. When the user is on the
          Homepage, the tag to homepage ‘disables’ and shows it as a ‘heading’
          or a text rather than a link to show as a visual communication. Then
          next section after Homepage, is a Blogs section. Users can also access
          it from a Homepage. When you click on the ‘Blogs’ , it takes you to
          where the different blogs are located being Week 1-4, however this
          might change. When the user is on the blogs page, users can still
          access other folders from this page. The link to this page disables
          when the user is on the page and shows it as a text, again for visual
          communication to show that they are on that current page.
        </p>

        <p>
          Challenges: Troubles with accessing other folders as they wouldn’t
          open such as the portfolio Layout of the website as I didn’t know what
          goes where Consistency of the navigation bar Microformats, as I didn't
          know where exactly to put them on the website. I am proud of my Blogs
          pages because it is a section where I think everything is in order if
          not most of the things. However, Going forward I’d probably want to
          change my URLs schemes, the consistency of the navigation bar or even
          across the website and making all pages accessible without errors

        <h2>Analysis of Websites (Blog 5 - Week 7)</h2>
        <h3>An Analysis of UI and UX on the Property24 Website</h3>
        <a href="https://www.property24.com/for-sale">https://www.property24.com/for-sale</a>
        <p>
          In the current digital era, websites efficiency is mostly determined
          on how well they balance between usability and visual attractiveness.
          One of the top online real estate marketplaces in South Africa
          Property24, offers a case studies for analyzing application of UI and
          UX design. Even though the website is effective providing a user
          experience that is visual pleasing and intuitive, it has its cons when
          it comes to its universal accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interface design refers to how users interact with websites, and the
          user interface is emphasized by features like visual hierarchy,
          responsiveness, layout, and navigation with that in mind Property24’s
          user interface has been well designed. With the homepages noticeable
          search-box, users will be able to start searching for properties based
          on price, type, and location which is essential to users finding
          properties based on a simplified searching tool. To provide a clear
          and uncomplicated interface, the website also uses understandable
          typefaces, a consistent color scheme, and enough white space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Property24’s user interface is another thing that makes it good as the
          website allows access on a laptop, tablet, or smartphone, and the
          layout works well on all of them, so users have a smooth experience no
          matter what device they use. There are high-resolution pictures, price
          tags, and short details of each property listing, which makes it easy
          for users to quickly decide if the property is right for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the UI is not without certain shortcomings. Some listing
          pages have too much information on them, making them look cluttered
          and a little overwhelming appearance.
        </p>

        <h3>An Analysis of UI and UX on the AutoTrader Website</h3>
        <a href="https://www.autotrader.co.za/cars-for-sale"
          >https://www.autotrader.co.za/cars-for-sale</a
        >
        <p>
          AutoTrader is South Africa’s leading digital platform for the selling
          and purchasing of new and used cars. As website experience continues
          to determine customers’ attitude, it is important for websites like
          Autotrader to have balanced effective UI and UX. While Autotrader
          succeeds in offering visual engaging and intuitive user experience, it
          fails to ensure comprehensive accessibility for all users.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a UI perspective, AutoTrader has demonstrated a high standard as
          the homepage is easy to navigate with a prominent search bar allowing
          users to filter vehicles by make, model, price and location. Because
          of this functionality, consumers may interact with the platform right
          away, demonstrating a user-first strategy, as fonts used are clear and
          simple to navigate based on the bold headlines used, clear vehicle
          photos and well-organized web page. However, it does not make it easy
          to use for a range of gadgets including smartphones, with the design
          of the filter setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the website does have some drawbacks, as noticed by the
          general layout advertising banners on some listings pages can make
          them visually overwhelming, as these components could divert users’
          attention from their main objectives. Furthermore, the added filtering
          feature sometimes breaks while navigating, requiring users to re-enter
          their search parameters.

      <article class="section" id="blog6">
        <h2> Research: Internet, Society and Design Justice (Blog 6 - Week 9) </h2>
        <p>The readings by <b>Spyros Kasapis</b>, "Internet Access is a Fundamepntal Right" (2020), and <b>Claire Daniolou</b>, "The Need for Global Internet Connectivity" (2020), address the urgent need for digital inclusion. Drawing from these perspectives and reflecting on the interview with Nanjira Sambuli, this response reflects on how digital design choices have a tendency to reinforce inequality and how a Design Justice perspective can yield more equitable solutions.</p>
        <p>
          From a Design Justice viewpoint, when many more population of people are excluded from digital platforms, it’s not just a technological gap but rather it becomes a systemic injustice. In fact, this digital infrastructure privileges the wealthy, urbanized, Western communities while silencing the voices of rural and global South. Kasapis calls us to reimagine internet governance with the question: who gets to determine the rules of the web? This short question throws politics into the works.  Design Justice challenges us to  engage communities most affected by design decisions directly in determining them which would include decisions about internet regulation, data policies, and access infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniolou highlights the economic, educational, and social benefits of being connected to the internet, particularly in rural communities. Examples among others include the GoGlobal, which shows how broadband access could uplift such regions suffering from the "rural penalty". Importantly, she also stresses that access alone is not enough — without technological literacy, the potential benefits of being connected cannot be maximized.
        </p>
        <p>
          As much as Daniolou stresses growth through connectivity, there is a danger of techno-solutionism: the belief that technology alone can fix systemic inequality. Design Justice warns us of this tendency. Simply bringing in technology without considering power dynamics, language access, local culture, or community agency risks replicating the same inequalities it seeks to solve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides this, Daniolou also touched on cultural erasure and misinformation, which are not mere side effects. In fact, they refer to the need for community-based, culturally-sensitive digital technologies that protect and empower diverse identities, instead of forcing global homogenization.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the interview with Nanjira Sambuli-digital equality advocate at the <i>World Wide Web Foundation</i>, they talk about how design practices mostly reinforce existing power structures unless intentionally disrupted. She calls for Design Justice, which involves redistributing power within design processes and enable marginalized communities to take on leadership in determining technologies, spaces, and systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          This directly connects to both Kasapis and Daniolou article that it's not just about access; it's also about whose interests are given priority, whose opinions are heard, and who controls the internet's design.

        <h2> Internet Access is a Fundamental Right (Blog 7 - Week 10) </h2>
        <h3>Introduction and Aim of the text:</h3>
        <p>
     Spyros Kasapis’s article argues for the recognition of internet access as a fundamental human right with particular reference to the socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  His primary goal is to reimagine digital access—not as luxury or mere convenience—but as a necessary prerequisite for full participation in modern life, especially in the digital economy, education, and public discourse. The unstated assumption of the article is that the digital divide increases existing inequalities and that universal access to the internet is necessary for democratic participation and human dignity.
        </p>

        <h3>Methodology:   </h3>
        <p>
        Kasapis begins with a reference to Salvador Allende's philosophical view of happiness conceived as a human right and argues that access to the internet, like education, food, and healthcare, is presently required for the exercising of that right. This argument places the internet not simply as infrastructure, but also as a social determinant of wellbeing. He substantiates his arguments by law: citing the judgment of the Indian Supreme Court that internet access is a fundamental right under free speech and privacy. This brief legal nod is intended to lend institutional authority to the argument, although the article lacks an in-depth legal or comparative analysis of international frameworks.
        </p>

        <h3>Step-by-Step Breakdown and Critical Analysis</h3>
        
<ol>
            <li><h4>Pandemic as a Revealer of Inequality </h4></li>
            <p>
        Kasapis sees the pandemic in the light of a “spotlight” to inequalities, like the digital divide. Social distancing made everyday life digitalized: work at home, learning without having to go to school, health services online —and exposed how many people were left behind. His claim that “almost half of the world’s population does not have access” serves as a powerful indictment of the current global infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Critical Reflection: While persuasive, this section would benefit from quantitative accuracy. For instance, in 2020 ITU reports, some 37% of the global population had never used the Internet, a rather astounding but more nuanced figure than “half.” The argument however really can be made stronger by including some discussion of access differences amongst regions, for example, sub-Saharan Africa or rural Asia.
       </p>

       <li>
        <h4>Digital Inequality as a New Form of Exclusion</h4>
       </li>
       <p>
        Kasapis suggests that we are witnessing the emergence of digital inequality as a distinct form of social exclusion. An instance he uses is the explosion in Amazon sales and the wealth of Jeff Bezos during the pandemic in contrast to the billions that were excluded from participating in the digital economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Critical Reflection: This particular section makes a strong ethical case but lacks concrete economic data. For example, how many of the unemployed were digitally excluded? What are the actual productivity gains enjoyed by digital firms? Such omissions might diminish the analytical depth, but serve a provocative moral function.
       </p>

       <li><h4>Is Internet Access a Right or a Means to Rights?</h4></li>
       <p>
        Kasapis acknowledges the philosophical tension between seeing internet access as a standalone right versus a facilitator of other rights. He avoids deciding in one direction or the other, although it appears he perhaps leans a little more to the former interpretation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Critical Reflection: This is the article’s most philosophically rich moment. Yet, he misses an opportunity to refer to literature on digital rights. The referencing of academic sources would help ground Kasapis's statement in academic discourse.
       </p>
       <li><h4>Power and Governance in the Digital Space</h4></li>
       <p>
        Kasapis ends with questions about whether governments should guarantee universal access and who should make rules about governance of the internet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Critical Reflection: These matters start very important debates on platform governance and state surveillance but do not really advance any road maps to putting concerns into concrete policies.
       </p>
</ol>
<h3>Connecting to Additional Research: Technocolonialism and the Geopolitics of Access</h3>
<p>
  Kasapis's call for equitable access gains relevance when juxtaposed with Giorgos Verdi's article on technocolonialism. Verdi outlines how AI superpowers shape global dependency through digital infrastructure. In contrast, Kasapis proposes digital sovereignty based on universal access and democracy.
</p>

<h3>Avenues for Future Research</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>Empirical study of the effects of digital exclusion</p></li>
  <li><p>Comparisons of national policies</p></li>
  <li><p>UX/UI practices for inclusivity</p></li>
  <li><p>Governance alternatives to Big Tech</p></li>
</ul>

        <h2>Critical Reflection: Making a Feminist Internet in Africa (Blog 8 - Week 11) </h2>
        <p>
          The excerpt from Making a Feminist Internet in Africa presents a compelling case for reimagining the ways African women and LGBTIQA+ persons engage with, shape, and get shaped by digital spaces. What stuck with me the most about this reading was that the internet is not merely a tool of access but a contested space of power, identity, and survival. It seeks to change the mainstream view of African technology use as something purely functional and views digital engagement as inherently political and personal, especially for marginalized groups.
As a digital arts student, I’m interested in how the internet becomes a site for both oppression and liberation. The reading resounded with concepts I had encountered in intersectional feminist theory-that visibility in digital space is also about resistance. As described here, the internet is merely continuing the realities of inequality found offline-racism, homophobia, sexism, or ableism-yet it is also the net that can be used as a tool to counter such inequalities by way of creativity, storytelling, or joy. The citing of body positivity, queer fashion, and makeup tutorials for gay boys as examples of "resistance made visible" makes me think that digital content truly holds the potential to accelerate cultural change.
        </p>
        <p>
          The part that resonated most was the recognition that many African voices remain missing online—not due to a lack of stories, but due to structural inequalities in access, infrastructure, and visibility. This comes close to describing my own personal experiences of how dominant online storytelling tends to happen from the West and fails to capture the complexities of African experience and identities. Having aspirations of working in UI/UX design, this reminds me even more about whose realities and experiences are put front and center while designing platforms and interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reading calls us to "create more room for African women online," is not a poetic invitation but a serious proposition to disrupt the status quo. It makes me look at my work not just as technical or artistic but as political. When we are designing systems, we must ask: who gets to feel safe here? Who gets to play, to be joyful, to be visible? A feminist internet, as imagined here, is not just an inclusive space- it is a joyful, pleasurable, and radically empathetic one. It asks us to center those most often marginalized and excluded, not as an afterthought but as an important foundation for building a better Internet.

        <h2>How our code matters in the context of decolonialism (Blog 9 - Week 12)</h2>
        <p>
          Working with HTML and CSS to build my sci-fi-themed website got me thinking more deeply about how the very structure and design of a website can illustrate larger systems of power and knowledge — especially after reading the Decolonial AI: Decolonial Theory as Sociotechnical Foresight in Artificial Intelligence piece by Mohamed. In this reading, the authors share how in the context of AI coloniality continues to determine who gets to create knowledge and who gets to be represented in digital spaces. In my own projects, I have come to realize that aesthetic choices in language (sticking primarily to English) and familiar Western design frameworks (i.e., grids, logos, visuals) can play a role in excluding other cultural expressions and ways of engaging in technology.
        </p>
       <p>
        This awareness has prompted me to be more thoughtful in the themes, languages, and aesthetics I choose. For example, moving forward, I’m eager to play around with Afrofuturist design elements that truly capture local and culturally significant perspectives in my sci-fi projects—rather than just copying the Westernised sci-fi styles.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the present time, I have designed and styled my website, using HTML and CSS to create the structure and visual design. My design considerations have been focused on the layout or footprint of the website, the typography, and maintaining a cohesive visual experience between pages. One of the next steps is to add JavaScript and dynamic aspects, such as a responsive hamburger menu, interactive elements, and a light/dark theme toggle.
       </p>
       <p>
        While these abilities may be something we take for granted, the Decolonial AI reading encourages me to reflect on: For whom are these interactions really for? How do I ensure that they are designed for users from various backgrounds, especially users who are on a mobile device or have limited internet access? This relates to the discussion in the paper regarding structural decolonisation, which means not only designing for functionality or aesthetics, but also questioning what values and assumptions are built into the coding of our interaction design.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that the addition of JavaScript will make my interaction design more fluid by allowing the website to be more intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly. But I also want to be thoughtful about it—asking how each interaction can help with broader goals of accessibility, representation, and inclusion, especially for communities often marginalized in tech.

      <h2>What does an ethical internet look like to you? (Blog 10 - Week 13)

</h2>
<p>
  An ethical Internet prioritizes human well-being, equity, accountibility, and causing no or limited harm. An ethical Internet is based on principles of inclusivity, privacy, transparency, and sustainability. New technologies should serve people rather than enrich them. Based on an article about Ethical Design and other research, this is what an ethical Internet should include:
</p>
<h4>1. Inclusive and Bias-Free Design</h4>
<p>The internet has to reach the entire population regardless of race, gender, ability, or socioeconomic status. The soap dispenser example that could not recognize darker skin tones illustrates how unrecognized biases in design can enforce exclusion. In particular, elements of an ethical internet would include:</p>

<ul>
        <li><p><dfn>Diverse representation:</dfn> in images, language, and user testing so stereotypes are not reinforced (e.g., only showing boys playing with a certain toy).</p></li>
        <li><p><dfn>Universal accessibility:</dfn> that ensures websites and internet applications meet the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) so people who may be differently able do not simply get marginalized.</p></li>
        <li><p><dfn>Cultural sensitivity:</dfn> Avoiding metaphors or symbols that might insult or exclude certain groups (such as skin-tone options for emojis).</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Privacy and Data Sovereignty</h4>
    <p>An ethical Internet is conscious of user privacy and affirms people's right to control their own data. The article identifies and suggests that our personal data, whether the individuals realize this or not, is usually exploited for profit, leading to the creation of surveillance capitalism. Ethical practice include:</p>
    <ul>
          
        <li><p><dfn>Minimal data collection:</dfn> Only gathering what's necessary</p></li>
        <li><p><dfn>Transparent consent:</dfn> Users should understand everything they are consenting to and avoid dark patterns (e.g., hidden opt-out provisions).</p></li>
        <li><p><dfn>Decentralization:</dfn> Technologies such as blockchain or federated platforms can help free users from the grip of monopolistic corporations</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>3. Transparency and Accountability</h4>
    <p>Tech companies need to be held accountable for the algorithmic and moderation practices. Ethical design includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><dfn>Explainable AI:</dfn> Users should be able to understand why algorithms recommend content to them (e.g., Facebook news feed or YouTube recommendations).</p></li>
        <li><p><dfn>Tackling misinformation:</dfn> Platforms must focus on getting users accurate information over maximising engagement (such as Twitter's fact-checking system).</p></li>
        <li><p><dfn>Ethically persuading:</dfn> Not using manipulative UX that causes mental harm (e.g., infinite scrolling, alerts that create addiction).</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4. Mental Health and Well-Being</h4>
    <p>There is much evidence surrounding social media's role in anxiety, depression, as well as polarization. Below are solutions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><dfn>Design for downtime:</dfn> Features like Instagram's "You're all caught up" or screen-time trackers.</p></li>
        <li><p><dfn>Ethical advertising:</dfn> Refuse to engage in predatory targeting (e.g., targeted advertising for gambling to vulnerable audiences)</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>An ethical internet is not a utopian ideal, but it does provide a framework to hold designers, corporations, and policymakers accountable. It also provides a challenge to ensure that technology aligns with human rights. As the article states, ethical design means "doing good and not harming anyone," doing so intentionally or unintentionally. Engaging with what the ethics of stages or principles means can lead to an internet that enables rather than exploits, that connects rather than divides, and that sustains rather than exhausts.</p>

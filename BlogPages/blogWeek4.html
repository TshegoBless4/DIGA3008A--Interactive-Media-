    <h1>Week 4 - Blog Post</h1>
    With my original wireframes for the Homepage I had a navigation bar for each and every folder, an image and a header that welcomes users to the website.

For my blogs page, I had a navigation bar and a section that  would  put images of the blogs.

For my current design section of my website, my website opens to a homepage. On the top of the page , is the navigation bar that would allow you to click on different sections such as the Portfolio, Design, and Blogs. Then after the navigation section, it is followed by a header written “Welcome t my page” accompanied by a picture of cars in the landscape however this might change into something that would describe me best such as an animated picture of myself.

When the user is on the Homepage, the tag to homepage ‘disables’ and shows it as a ‘heading’ or a text rather than a link to show as a visual communication.

Then next section after Homepage, is a Blogs section. Users can also access it from a Homepage. When you click on the ‘Blogs’ , it takes you to where the different blogs are located being Week 1-4, however this might change.

When the user is on the blogs page, users can still access other folders from this page. The link to this page disables when the user is on the page and shows it as a text, again for visual communication to show that they are on that current page.

 

<p>Challenges:

Troubles with accessing other folders as they wouldn’t open such as the portfolio
Layout of the website as I didn’t know what goes where
Consistency of the navigation bar
Microformats, as I didn't know where exactly to put them on the website.
I am proud of my Blogs pages because it is a section where I think everything is in order if not most of the things. However, Going forward I’d probably want to change my URLs schemes, the consistency of the navigation bar or even across the website and making all pages accessible without errors </p>

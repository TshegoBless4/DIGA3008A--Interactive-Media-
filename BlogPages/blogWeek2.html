    <h1>Week 2- blog Post</h1>
    <p data-blog-week1="Digital Arts">
      Stuart Moulthrop’s essay explores the evolution of hypertext, its
      revolutionary potential, and its digital era effects. He shows how
      hypertext develops from Vannevar Bush’s concept of the Memex, and how it
      led towards the development of digital text as we understand it today.
      Moulthrop also explores what happens when hypertext is pushed to its
      limit, using Marshall McLuhan’s theory that every medium, when pushes to
      its limits, reverses into its opposite. He also continues to question
      whether hypertext as an interactive and open medium will join the pattern
      of radio and television, which started as interactive but later became
      corporate-controlled and hierarchical, so in essence he questions whether
      hypertext would remain a tool of free interaction or become a controlled
      system. How does this speak to the internet today? The early web was an
      open space where users could contribute freely and share knowledge or
      information. For instance, when Wikipedia was developed in 2001, anyone
      could contribute and edit articles. But as years went by, the internet
      followed the pattern of radio and television becoming a controlled system
      that is dominated by big corporate companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon
      etc that is driven by algorithms, data collection and advertising. For
      instance social media platforms such as Tiktok, Instagram and Facebook
      controls interactions by dictating what we see using algorithms. While
      this may be a good thing to some, the disadvantages is that it reduces the
      ability to explore other things freely. We have come to notice that a web
      is now a marketplace and most people rely on on it to market their
      businesses or companies using advertisements.

    <h2>Folder structure and URL Scheme</h2>
    When designing my folder structure I aim for a clean structure to keep my
    files organised. So for instance in my Root folder (/) will contain main
    entry of the website being Index.html: This will direct users to different
    sections like home, Blog, Portfolio and design process. Home folder will
    contain (/home/) About.html where it will talk about myself or my work
    Contact.html: where my contacts will be put Portfolio (/portfolio/) Will
    showcase my previous projects so: index.html: The portfolio landing page,
    listing all projects.
    <h3>URL Scheme</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../index.html" target="_blank"> mywebsite → Home</a></li>
      <li>
        <a href="../BlogPages/blogMain.html" target="_blank"
          >mywebsite → Blogs</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>

    URL Scheme and Decision-Making: About → mywebsite.com/home/about.html
    Portfolio page → mywebsite.com/portfolio/ Inspirational websites
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank"
        >pexels:https://www.pexels.com/</a
      >
    </li>

      What does interaction mean to me? To me it is about anticipation and
      engagement. The internet allows users to not only consume content but to
      interact with it by commenting or sharing making it an interaction
